# React - TDD - SOLID - Clean Architecture

Project made following an outdated course [ReactJS, Hooks, Recoil, TDD, Clean Architecture, SOLID](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-com-mango/), focused on TDD, Clean Architecture and SOLID on front-end #react-way, to flex some different approaches.

- Filtering out bad practices that have been improved over time, especially in front-end testing practices.

- Ignoring some design choices and improving others;

- Integrating new tools like Vite, Vitest, tailwind, github-actions;

- In the future, the goal is to refactor the project to use the Next.js Router and its associated `shenanigans`;
